# Gesture-Volume-Control
The goal of this project is to develop a gesture-based volume control system for live video feeds using opencv, an open-source computer vision library. The system will be designed to take in a live video feed as input and allow the user to adjust the volume of the audio associated with the video by making specific hand gestures in front of the camera.

To build the system, we will first identify the relevant hand gestures to use for volume control, such as a hand raising or lowering, or a closed fist. We will then use opencv to track the hand in the video frame and recognize the gesture being made.

Once the hand gesture is identified, the system will adjust the volume of the audio accordingly. In order to ensure accurate and responsive volume control, we will fine-tune the gesture recognition model using a dataset of hand gestures and apply smoothing techniques to the volume control output.

Overall, this project will demonstrate the ability to use opencv to develop a user-friendly and intuitive gesture-based volume control system for live video feeds.
